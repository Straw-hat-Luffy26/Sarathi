//! Generation Scheduler — serialized access to the single loaded model.
//!
//! Only one model fits in VRAM, and llama.cpp generation is blocking, so exactly
//! one generation can run at a time. Before this module, callers reached for the
//! runtime mutex directly and held it for the *entire* generation — which meant
//! `get_inference_status` blocked until the answer finished, and any second
//! caller silently stalled with no feedback.
//!
//! This replaces that free-for-all with an explicit queue:
//!
//! - One dedicated OS thread owns model access and processes jobs in order.
//!   A dedicated thread rather than `spawn_blocking` because generation can run
//!   for minutes and must not occupy a shared blocking-pool slot.
//! - Callers get a stream of tokens back plus their position in the queue, so a
//!   waiting request can say "2 ahead of you" instead of appearing hung.
//! - Cancellation is immediate and lock-free: the cancel flag is cloned out of
//!   the runtime *before* generation starts, so setting it never has to take the
//!   mutex the generation itself is holding.
